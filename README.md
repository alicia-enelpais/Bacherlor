# Bachelor Thesis: Bézier Curves and Surfaces in Computer Design

This repository contains materials related to my bachelor thesis, which explores the mathematical foundations, practical applications, and implementation of Bézier curves and surfaces in computer-aided geometric design.

## Overview

Bézier curves and surfaces are fundamental tools in computer graphics, CAD systems, and various engineering fields. This thesis investigates how these mathematical constructs are defined, manipulated, and visualized, with a focus on their use in digital modeling and design.

## Contents

- **BezierTikz.tex**: LaTeX source file demonstrating the construction and visualization of Bézier curves using the TikZ package.
- **TFG_subdivisi_n(7).pdf**: The compiled PDF of the thesis document (likely in Spanish), which details the theory, algorithms, and applications of Bézier curves and surface subdivision.
- **Untitled.m**: MATLAB/Octave script(s) possibly used for computational experiments or visualizations.
- **teacup_nodes.txt, teacup_rectangles.txt, teaspoon_nodes.txt, teaspoon_rectangles.txt**: Data files that may contain control points and mesh data used in examples or case studies.

## Getting Started

To view and compile the LaTeX visualizations:
1. Install a LaTeX distribution (such as TeX Live or MiKTeX) with the TikZ package.
2. Compile `BezierTikz.tex` to generate illustrations of Bézier curves and control structures.

To run MATLAB scripts:
1. Open `Untitled.m` in MATLAB or Octave.
2. Execute the script to reproduce computational results or visualizations.

## Thesis Document

The main thesis document is provided as a PDF:
- [TFG_subdivisi_n(7).pdf](./TFG_subdivisi_n(7).pdf)
